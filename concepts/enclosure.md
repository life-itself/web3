## Enclosure
Historically *enclosure* referred to the feudal appropriation of common land or public goods by a [cartel](cartel.md) or nobility. In modern terms it refers to the process by which businesses corner a market through predatory capitalism and [regulatory capture](regulatory-capture.md) to ensure they can rent seek in perpetuity. This is often done through undercutting competitors through anti-competitive pricing schemes or subsidizing services by an influx of external capital to drive out competition. 

See also [market manipulation](market-manipulation.md), [public goods problem](public-goods-problem.md) and [free rider problem](free-rider-problem.md).
