# Libertariansm
A political ideology that aims to minimize the role of government in the lives of citizens and in the [market](../market.md).  Libertarians generally believe in the minimisation of [public goods](../public-goods-problem.md) and instead replace them with free-market driven solutions. Libertarianism is often correlated with ideas of tax minimization or avoidance which are viewed as form of "plunder" by the state.

Libertarians generally believe in a minimal nation state whose role exists to provide for public defense, the rule of law, and to enforce civil contract law.

See also [technosolutionism](technosolutionism.md), [cryptoanarchism](../cryptoanarchism.md) and [post-state technocracy](../../notes/post-state-technocracy.md).
