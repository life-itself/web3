# Technolibertarianism
 Technolibertarianism is an extension of [libertarianism](libertarianism.md) with the belief that technology is a liberatory force to ensure civil liberties, encourage the operation of free markets without government intervention and avoid over-regulation.

Technolibertarianism is particularly aligned with the use of cryptography, [cryptoasset](../cryptoasset.md) and [censorship-resistence](../censorship-resistence.md) tools to protect against what they see as government overreach into 
the financial lives of citizens. The ideology is predicated on a distrust of institutions and command-and-control structures, and a preference for technical solutions with  philosophical appeals to [decentralization](../decentralization.md).

See also [cryptoanarchism](cryptoanarchism.md), [libertarianism](libertarianism.md), and [post-state-technocracy](../../notes/post-state-technocracy.md).
