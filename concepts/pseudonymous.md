# Pseudonymous
The pseudo-privacy property of a crypto [wallet](wallet.md) of having no default direct identity attached to the data stored on a [blockchain](blockchain.md) network. Yet possibly having the capacity to recover the identity of the individual by tracking transactions through [crypto exchanges](cryptoasset.md) which perform [KYC](kyc.md) onboarding to associate wallet addresses with personal identities.
