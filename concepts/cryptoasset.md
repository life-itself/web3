# Crypto Asset
A digital [asset](assets.md) that is traded on a [blockchain](blockchain.md) network. Sometimes also referred to by "cryptocurrency" although this namesake has semantic issues due to confusion around differing [currency](currency.md) definitions.

Examples of crypto assets include, but are not limited to:
* [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md)
* [Ethereum](ethereum.md)
* [Dogecoin](dogecoin.md)
* [Stablecoins](stablecoin.md)
* [Governance tokens](governance-token.md)
* [NFTs](nft.md)
