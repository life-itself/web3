# Marxism
A political ideology rooted in the ideas of Karl Marx which asserts the inherent intellectual contradictions at the heart of [capitalism](../capitalism.md) and [market](../market.md). Marx defines a heterodox reading of [value](../value.md) based on philosophy and history and attempts to derive a new system in which [price-formation](../price-formation.md) can occur without the existing superstructure of capitalism.

See also [[commodity fetishism]] and [sign value](../sign-value.md).
