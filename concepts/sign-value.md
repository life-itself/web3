# Sign Value
Sign value denotes and describes the intangible value accorded to an object because of the prestige or social status that it imparts upon the possessor, rather than the [use value](use-value.md) and [income cashflows](income-cashflows.md) derived from the function or use of the asset.

See [art](art.md), [narrative economics](narrative-economics.md), [endowment effect](endowment-effect.md) and [bandwagon bias](bandwagon-bias.md).
