# Gambling
An economic activity in which one party pays for the privilege of risking money on a probabilistic activity with negative [expected-return](expected-return.md). Often gambling games are [negative-sum](zero-sum-game.md).

Trading [crypto assets](cryptoasset.md) is often compared to gambling.
