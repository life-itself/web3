# Platform Risk
In financial risk analysis, *platform risk* is the risk that the [market maker](market-maker.md) or trading platform ceases to operate as a company. In this event the customers of the platform may be left without the ability to realize their [paper wealth](paper-wealth.md) or withdraw funds that are tied up in the defunct company without a liquidation path.

Unregulated [crypto exchanges](crypto-exchange.md) are subject to extreme [platform risk](platform-risk.md).
