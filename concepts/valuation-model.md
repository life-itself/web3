# Valuation Model
A mathematical model to calculate the [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md) of a [security](security.md). The field of quantitative finance concerns itself with the pricing and optimal allocation of securities contracts in terms of their [income cashflows](income-cashflows.md) and the risks associated with the assets.

See also [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md) and [present value](present-value.md).
