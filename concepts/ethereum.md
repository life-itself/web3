# Ethereum

Ethereum is a [blockchain](blockchain.md) protocol and [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md) that extends the [bitcoin](bitcoin.md) model to allow the execution of [smart contracts](smart-contracts.md).

NB: following common usage we are using Ethereum for both the protocol itself, its mainnet and its associated token Ether or ETH.

## Properties

Ethereum is based on the [consensus algorithm](consensus-algorithm.md) known as Proof of Stake (having shifted from Proof of Work in late 2022)

Ethereum is not a [currency](currency.md). Ethereum is a protocol and Ether is a protocol token and not a currency.

Ethereum is [deflationary](deflationary.md).

Ethereum is a [bearer instrument](bearer-instrument.md).

Ethereum has no [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md).

Ethereum has no [use value](use-value.md) (like most financial assets).

Ethereum has no [income-cashflows](income-cashflows.md).

Ethereum has a [present-value](present-value.md) of zero.

Ethereum has a [market-value](market-value.md) derived from a combination of speculation and use for transactions on the network.

Ethereum has a [terminal-value](terminal-value.md) of zero.

Ethereum is a [non-productive](productive-asset.md) investment.

Ethereum has a negative [expected return](expected-return.md).

Ethereum is a [security](security.md).
