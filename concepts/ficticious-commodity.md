# Fictitious commodities
A *fictitious commodity* or *pseudo-commodity* is a product is traded like a commodity but has no [use value](use-value.md) and its demand curve is not generated by any external economic processes. It is a [non-economic](non-economic.md) product which is generated either through [enclosure](enclosure.md), [artificial demand](artificial-demand.md) or as part of a [greater fool](greater-fool-theory.md) scheme or bubble.

Structurally similar to a [financial asset](financial-asset.md), but unlike a financial asset it renders no contractual claims on [income cashflows](income-cashflows.md) and thus has zero [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md).

Examples of fictitious commodities include:

* Many [crypto assets](cryptoasset.md)
* [NFTs](nft.md)
* Name-A-Star Registries
* [Indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence)

See also [Tinkerbell effect](tinkerbell-effect.md), [bubble](bubble.md) and [market mania](market-mania.md).
