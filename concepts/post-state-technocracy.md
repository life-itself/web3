# Post-state Technocracy
The political ideology that [blockchain](../blockchain.md) and [cryptoasset](../cryptoasset.md) are a tool to dismantle nation states and install a form of anarchism in which governance and institutions are replaced with technology and a new global transnational plutocracy of those holding crypto assets.

See also [technosolutionism](technosolutionism.md), [cryptoanarchism](../cryptoanarchism.md) and [libertarianism](../libertarianism.md).
