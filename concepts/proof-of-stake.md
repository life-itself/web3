# Proof of Stake
A type of work function used in [blockchain](blockchain.md) [consensus algorithms](consensus-algorithm.md) that involves network participants [staking](staking.md) an amount of a [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md) which grants them a probabilistic chance to confirm a block (and receive block award) in proportion to the amount of assets they stake.

Proof of stake has been criticized for being intentionally plutocratic and a scheme that overtly enriches those with existing wealth and early investors in the scheme, thus resulting in [consolidation](distribution-problem.md) of the [crypto asset](cryptoasset.md) into the hands of the few. Proof of stake has also been critized for having a less [censorship resistent](censorship-resistence.md) security model as it may encourage collusion and [cartels](cartel.md).

See also [mining](mining.md), [proof of work](proof-of-work.md),  [environmental footprint of crypto](../claims/is-environmental-footprint.md).
