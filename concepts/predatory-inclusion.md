# Predatory Inclusion
Predatory inclusion refers to a process whereby members of a marginalized group are provided with access to a good, service, or opportunity from which they have historically been excluded but under suboptimal or risky conditions that jeopardize the benefits of access.

With regards to financial assets this concept is typically discussed in conjunction with the [unbanked](unbanked.md).

See [crypto exchange](crypto-exchange.md).
