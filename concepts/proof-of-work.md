# Proof of Work
A type of work function used in [blockchain](blockchain.md) [consensus algorithms](consensus-algorithm.md) that involves a race to solve to invert a function to find a specific number which is added to a block of transactions to add it to a chain of blocks. In computer science terms, the participants in this system race to compute the *preimage* to a hash function.

Proof of work mining has been criticized for being intentionally wasteful and consuming vast amounts of silicon resources and compute time.
