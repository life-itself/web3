# Market
A market is defined as the sum total of all the buyers and sellers with regards to the buying and selling of assets. The purpose of a market is to do [price discovery](price-formation.md) to determine [market-value](market-value.md) of goods and services.

The business of creating markets is known as [market making](market-maker.md). The business of [gambling](gambling.md) is not market making as no goods or services are exchanged.
