# Collateralization
In finance, collateral is a borrower's commitment of property to a lender as a means to secure against [counterparty risk](counterparty-risk.md) and ensure repayment of a loan.

*Overcollateralization* is used to define types of [loan products](financial-asset.md) where an asset value used as collateral on a loan exceeds the loan value. This is sometimes used by borrowers to reduce credit risk for the creditor and enhance the loan's credit rating.
