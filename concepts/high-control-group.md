# High Control Group
A social group or movement in which the members are strongly influenced by the suggestions of a group leader or group as a whole and in which dissent or reflection on the ideology are discouraged. Often incorporates a narrative about an ingroup and outgroup.

This type of group will often adopt a disfigurement of language and [thought terminating cliches](thought-terminating-cliches.md) in order to communicate within the ingroup.

See also [madness-crowds](madness-crowds.md), [bandwagon bias](bandwagon-bias.md), [whataboutism](whataboutism.md) and [thought terminating cliches](thought-terminating-cliches.md).
