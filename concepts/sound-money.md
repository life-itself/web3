# Sound Money
An [Austrian economics](austrian-economics.md) philosophy that an idealized [currency](currency.md) should be backed by a finite unchanging supply and fixed supply of a [commodity](commodity.md), or more recently a [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md).

Sound money is an antiquated ideology that, along with the [gold standard](gold-standard.md), is rejected in modern economic thought.

See [gold standard](gold-standard.md) and [libertarianism](libertarianism.md).
