# Memecoin
A meme coin is a [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md) which has no pretense of [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md) or [utility](use-value.md) but instead is a [greater fool](greater-fool-theory.md) investment based trend-following of an image or symbol in popular culture.

See [dogecoin](dogecoin.md) and [financial nihilism](financial-nihilism.md).
