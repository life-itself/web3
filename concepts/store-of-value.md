# Store of Value
A store of value is an [asset](../concepts/assets.md) that maintains purchasing power into the future and can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when required.

A store of value should have a low-variance in its [market value](../concepts/market-value.md) on long time scales. Hypervolatile assets do not make for good stores of value.
