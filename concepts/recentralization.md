# Recentralization
A term for [blockchain](blockchain.md) projects which alleges [decentralization](decentralization.md) in either their technical design or political imaginaries, yet produce an outcome in which control of the protocol remains centralized in the hands of one or several central parties. Projects may achieve this end either intentionally or unintentionally.

See [web3](web3.md) and [DeFi](defi.md).
