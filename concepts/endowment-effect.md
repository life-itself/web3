# Endowment Effect
The endowment effect is a result in behavioral economical that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it. It is a cognitive distortion in which the perceived [value](value.md) of an [asset](assets.md) is biased by the act of owning it and ties into the psychological phenomenon of loss aversion. Instead of objectively valuing the [asset](asset.md), independent of their holdings, the individual will overvalue assets they currently hold.
