# Cryptoanarchism
Cryptoanarchism or cyberanarchism is a political ideology the aim of which is to achieve the protection of privacy, political freedom and economic freedom through the use of cryptography and [crypto assets](../cryptoasset.md). Cryptoanarchism sees itself as a reaction to the overreach of governments and the state into the private and financial lives of citizens and asserts the need for so-called *total freedom*. 

* Total anonymity of individuals in the digital spaces
* Total freedom of speech without censorship or moderation
* Total freedom to trade without regulation or protections

The idea revolves around the politics that individuals are self-sovereign and that the internet or cyberspace as a whole is an independent territory outside the remit and regulation of governments. This is outlined in the seminal writing by cryptoanarchist leader John Barlow in his writing *A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace*.

The ideas behind [bitcoin](../bitcoin.md) can be traced to another seminal work, *The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*.
