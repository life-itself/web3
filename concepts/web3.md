# Web3

An umbrella term for a variety of endeavours to integrate [crypto assets](cryptoasset.md), [NFTs](nft.md), [DAOs](dao.md), [DeFi](defi.md) and [smart contracts](smart-contracts.md) into existing web infrastructure.

It is important to be aware that Web3 both lacks a precise definition and has become an intellectual nexus for grand visions of technical and financial reconfiguration.
