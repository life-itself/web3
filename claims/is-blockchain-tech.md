# Is the underlying technology of "blockchain" useful for non-monetary purposes?
Blockchain technology, detached from the sale of tokens or [crypto assets](../concepts/cryptoasset.md) a has shown no track record of providing benefit for any real world applications. So-called [permissioned blockchain](../concepts/permissioned-blockchain.md) solutions offer no benefits over traditional database solutions and introduce a great deal of additional complexity for no value add.

The technical purpose of blockchains is to create [censorship resistent](../concepts/censorship-resistence.md) networks for the issuance of [crypto asset](../concepts/cryptoasset.md) for [regulatory arbitrage](../concepts/regulatory-arbitrage.md) of [securities](../concepts/security.md) law and [illicit financing](../concepts/illicit-financing.md) purposes. There is no proven use case for the technology outside of scofflawing.
