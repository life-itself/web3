# Crypto tokens are not a means to destroy capitalism 

Crypto tokens are indeed a form of [predatory investment](../concepts/predatory-inclusion.md) that may have wide-reaching consequences in the lives of people it harms. However it is not a means to accelerate the collapse of capitalism even if one subscribes to the [accelerationism](../concepts/accelerationism.md) school of thought and believed this the acceleration of capitalism and its destruction was a good thing.

The crypto ideology is an extension of neoliberal project that aims to expand the scope and reach of markets to all aspects of human life, a concept often referred to [as hyperfinancialization](is-hyperfinancialization.md). Since crypto tokens aim to expand the scope of capitalism, they cannot bring about anything but more capitalism.
