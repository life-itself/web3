**Web3 is not a means to disrupt the American tech hegemony, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.**

The only means they do scale is by [recentralization](../concepts/recentralization.md) thereby recreating just another corporate monolith but based on inferior technology and without the ability to perform [regulatory arbitrage](../concepts/regulatory-arbitrage.md).
