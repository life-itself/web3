# Web3 is not decentralized

In all scenarios web3 still requires central parties for its technical operation and simply involves [recentralization](../concepts/recentralization.md) of services that already exist. Since web3 is centralized then it has neither the [censorship resistance](../concepts/censorship-resistence.md) properties or [decentralization](../concepts/decentralization.md) claims its myth-making and marketing claims.

Web3 is either a completely nonsensical buzzword, or a term about reinventing existing business models either poorly or as a thinly veiled scheme for securities fraud for transferring wealth from the public to a few (centralized) operators of the scheme.
