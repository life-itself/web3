# Why do people invest in crypto assets?
As has been consistently noted [2,3,8] throughout historical [market manias](../concepts/market-mania.md), the behavior of investors is not always rational and the investor herd mentality and [madness of crowds](../concepts/madness-crowds.md) sometimes gives rise to [bubbles](../concepts/bubble.md). Burton Malkiel wrote in his book *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*:

> A [bubble](../concepts/bubble.md) starts when any group of stocks, in this case those associated with the excitement of the Internet, begin to rise. The updraft encourages [more people](../concepts/bandwagon-bias.md) to buy the stocks, which causes more TV and print coverage, which causes even more people to buy, which creates big profits for early Internet stockholders. The successful investors tell you at cocktail parties how easy it is to get rich, which causes the stocks to rise further, which pulls in larger and larger groups of investors. But the whole mechanism is a kind of [Ponzi scheme](../concepts/ponzi-scheme.md) where more and more credulous investors must be found to buy the stock from the earlier investors. Eventually, one runs out of [greater fools](../concepts/greater-fool-theory.md)

This coupled with the [weird subculture](weird-culture.md) of crypto assets and a [narrative economics](../concepts/narrative-economics.md) of belonging to a [high control group](../concepts/high-control-group.md) with the promises of [easy money](../concepts/ponzi-scheme.md) is a psychologically enticing proposition for a large demographic. The synthesis of the market mania and the narrative appeal of the culture and its political [imaginarires](../concepts/narrative-economics.md) appears to be the main driver of the crypto bubble.

There is also a strong sample bias in self-reported winnings of crypto assets. With partipants who make outsized returns [gambling](../concepts/gambling.md) on the [bubble](../concepts/bubble.md) are more likely to report this returns compared to the vast majority of those who lost money as guaranteed by the [negative-sum](../concepts/zero-sum-game.md) dynamics of gambling on [crypto assets](../concepts/cryptoasset.md).

See [madness of crowds](../concepts/madness-crowds.md), [bubble](../concepts/bubble.md), [market mania](../concepts/market-mania.md), [speculation](../concepts/speculation.md) and [bandwagon bias](../concepts/bandwagon-bias.md).
