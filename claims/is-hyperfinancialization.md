# Is crypto bringing about the "financialization of everything"?

The purpose of NFTs and crypto projects generally is to further expand the scope [artificial scarcity](../concepts/artificial-scarcity.md), [enclose](../concepts/enclosure.md) and financialize greater portions of the human experience. The stated aim of the web3 and crypto project is world in which all aspects of human life (art, justice, philosophy, politics, relationships) are simply [ficticious commodities](../concepts/ficticious-commodity.md) to be traded in a market place and that human beings should subordinate all free will, individuality and rationality to the market. 

The embodiment of the web3 and crypto ideology is an example of what the political theorist Macpherson denoted *possessive individualism*:

> [Possessive individualism is a philosophy] in which an individual is conceived as the sole proprietor of his or her skills and owes nothing to society for them. These skills (and those of others) are a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market, and in such a society is demonstrated a selfish and unending thirst for consumption which is considered the crucial core of human nature. 

Projects like NFTs and the their increasing enclosure of culture have indicated that the intent of crypto is nothing but the complete domination of the human experience by Capital in the bleak dystopian future imagined by their acolytes.
