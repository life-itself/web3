Raising money for a common venture is a [regulated](../concepts/regulation.md) as a [security](../concepts/security.md) sale in the United States. Raising money under a SAFT or selling tokens as a proxy for equity may run afoul of the Securities Act.

This was evidenced by the [ICO](../concepts/ico.md) bubble of 2017 which resulted in a net ban on initial coin offerings for illegal fundraising activities.
