# Claim steel-manned

Crypto assets have no [income-cashflows](../concepts/income-cashflows.md) therefore investing in crypto assets is a [negative sum game](../concepts/zero-sum-game.md) as defined in game theory and economics. Negative sum games result in a net loss across participants and multiple losers associated with every one winner.

# Evidence of claim being made

Diehl, Stephen. [@smdiehl]. Tweet. Twitter, 18 March 2021. https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1372495197926490114.

> ...miners and market makers... extract about $12,000,000/day from the pool.
> This cash outflow changes the dynamics of investing in bitcoin from being a zero sum game, into a negative sum game. 
> There are strictly more losers than winners, and if you sum over all participants the entire scheme *destroys wealth* rather than creating it.

McCauley, Robert. ‘Why Bitcoin Is Worse than a Madoff-Style Ponzi Scheme’. Financial Times, 22 December 2021.

> Another big difference between bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme is that the former is, from an aggregate or social standpoint, a negative sum game.
> ...the negative sum in the bitcoin game is in tens of billions of dollars and rising at over a billion dollars per month. If the price of bitcoin collapses to zero, the gains of those who sold would fall short of the losses of holders by this growing sum.

# Evaluation: True (high confidence)

Since crypto assets are [investments](../concepts/security.md), the purpose of buying a crypto asset is to buy it at a lower price and sell it at a higher price to generate a return denominated in a [real currency](../concepts/currency.md). However as an investment crypto assets have no [income-cashflows](../concepts/income-cashflows.md), the only money that exists to pay out investors is money that is brought in by later investors. This makes the entire scheme a [zero sum game](../concepts/zero-sum-game.md). All money won by [speculation](../concepts/speculation.md) is ultimately money that is equally lost by another participant. Once  you take into account the exchanges and miners taking a rake on the game, the entire structure becomes strictly negative-sum. 

Investing in crypto is comparable with poker and other gambling games. The only money that can be won in a poker game "pot" is provided by the players of the card game. The act of playing poker does not generate any money, it simply redistributes to participants according to a game of chance. If the "house" or casino takes a percentage of the pot on every round of the game played then the size of the pot must decrease over time. This turns the zero-sum game into a negative-sum game which admits a negative [expected return](../concepts/expected-return.md).
