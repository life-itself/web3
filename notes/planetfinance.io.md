> [**Planet**](https://blue.planetfinance.io) is a decentralized financial protocol consisting of different planets, each their own application, designed to enable anyone to freely activate their capital. Planet offers access to open, decentralized financial services.
> 
> The Planet community is on the endless hunt for the best DeFi opportunities in the space. Planet either aggregates the best opportunity or creates it.

> Fair Distribution, Tokenomics & What Makes Planet Unique

[Ed: of course it's fair!]

> - Planet is a yield-discovery protocol enabling anyone to create value for themselves using their crypto assets.
