* [Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies: Burn It With Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCHab0dNnj4) - 2018-04-20 by Nicholas Weaver 📺 Nicholas Weaver is a staff researcher with the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and lecturer in EECS, where he teaches machine structures and computer security. He earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Berkeley in 2003 and joined ICSI to study network security and measurement. "The entire cryptocurrency and blockchain ecology is rife with frauds, criminalities, and tulip-mania style hype and needs to be properly disposed of into the ashes of history. A “blockchain” is just a horribly inefficient append-only file which costs a literal fortune to secure without actually providing meaningful distributed trust, while cryptocurrencies are provably inferior than actual currencies for legal real world transactions. Beyond the sheer uselessness have emerged a whole host of bad ideas, ranging from the “put a bird^H^H^H^H blockchain on it” hype to unregistered (and mostly fraudulent) securities with “Initial Coin Offerings” to an invitation for massive theft in the form of “smart” contracts."

A Ponzi scheme is a zero-sum enterprise. But bitcoin is a negative-sum phenomenon that you can’t even pursue a claim against, argues Robert McCauley.

  > Once upon a time in Albania, a scrappy, alternative finance industry emerged to take on and eventually supplant a sclerotic, technologically-backward banking system. The lessons from its dramatic collapse remain relevant today. 
  >
  > Essentially, what was initially touted as a post-communist entrepreneurial success story proved to be pyramid schemes of breathtaking proportions. Slick marketing and lofty promises turned an informal, decentralised, crime-facilitating ecosystem into a mainstream mania that sucked in multitudes of people, unchecked by feeble and fitful regulatory warnings.

### Scams/frauds

* [People Building ‘Blockchain City’ in Wyoming Scammed by Hackers - Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7w3am/people-building-blockchain-city-in-wyoming-scammed-by-hackers) - 2022-01-12 - On Monday, CityDAO—the group that bought 40 acres of Wyoming in hopes of "building a city on the Ethereum blockchain”—announced that its Discord server was hacked and members' funds were successfully stolen as a result.

### DAOs

* [Is The DAO going to be DOA?](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@dan/is-the-dao-going-to-be-doa) - 2016-05-16 - by Dan Larimer (founder of BitShares and much else). Larimer sets out most of the basic critiques of DAOs as governance innovation extremely well:
  > Fancy technology can obscure our assessment of what is really going on. The DAO solves a single problem: the corrupt trustee or administrator. It replaces voluntary compliance with a corporation’s charter under threat of lawsuit, with automated compliance with software defined rules. This subtle change may be enough to bypass regulatory hurdles facing traditional trustee’s and administrators, but it doesn’t solve most of the problems the regulations were attempting to address.
  >
  > What The DAO doesn’t solve is all of the other problems inherent with any joint venture. These are people problems, economic problems, and political problems. In some sense, The DAO creates many new problems caused by its ridged rules and expensive machine-enforced process for change.
  >
  > The DAO doesn’t solve the “group trap” where by losers subsidize winners. It disempowers the individual actor and forces him to submit to group decision making. It doesn’t make raising money cheaper for companies, it just adds blockchain-enforced bureaucratic and political processes.

## Iron-manning the pro arguments

Here we collect the best theses for why this is important/interesting/world-changing.

### Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin for the Open-Minded Skeptic](https://www.matthuang.com/bitcoin_for_the_open_minded_skeptic) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]. Note: more an argument for why Bitcoin will "make it" than any argument why that is socially valuable (or not).
* [7 Things To Read About Bitcoin (For Institutional Investors)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/05/7-things-to-read-about-bitcoin-for-institutional-investors/) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]

### General

* [JumpCrypto Crypto Reading List (on Github)](https://github.com/JumpCrypto/crypto-reading-list)

### Web3

* [Sean Bonner: Why Web3](https://blog.seanbonner.com/2021/10/26/why-web3/) - 2021-10-26 - by Sean Bonner. "Web3 upends the power structures we’ve grown accustomed to and puts artists and creators back into the drivers seat. ,,, Web3 offers a future where people are in charge of their own identities, not beholden to the whims of data hoarding corporations. People control their own accounts, own their own futures. ... So if you are asking “Why Web3?” The answer is simple. Web3 is the future."

### Fat protocols

From https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/

> The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of “thin” protocols and “fat” applications.
>
> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” applications.

* [Crypto Tokens and the Coming Age of Protocol Innovation](https://continuations.com/post/148098927445/crypto-tokens-and-the-age-of-protocol-innovation) - 2016-07-28 - by Albert Wenger at USV. Move about incentivizing investment in the protocols
* [Fat Protocols](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) - Aug 2016 - Joel Monegro at USV - more about incentivizing adoption

### Fairer governance

Can support more democratic, distributed governance, e.g. cooperatives (somehow). Can save Democracy.

* [If I Only had a Heart: a DisCO Manifesto](https://disco.coop/manifesto/) - Dec 2019 - A joint publication by DisCO.coop, the Transnational Institute and Guerrilla Media Collective. "Value Sovereignty, Care Work, Commons and Distributed Cooperative Organizations. The DisCO Manifesto is a deep dive into the world of Distributed Cooperative Organizations. Over its 80 colorful pages, you will read about how DisCOs are a P2P/Commons, cooperative and Feminist Economic alternative to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The DisCO Manifesto also includes some background on topics like blockchain, AI, the commons, feminism, cooperatives, cyberpunk, and more."
* [Wired: The Father of Web3 Wants You to Trust Less](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/) - 2021-11-29 - Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3 in 2014, believes decentralized technologies are the only hope of preserving liberal democracy.

### Fairer Economy

* [Li Jin on the future of the creator economy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/li-jin-on-the-future-of-the-creator-economy) - Shared ownership and control of online platforms is the way forward (via crypto)
