* [Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies: Burn It With Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCHab0dNnj4) - 2018-04-20 by Nicholas Weaver 📺 Nicholas Weaver is a staff researcher with the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and lecturer in EECS, where he teaches machine structures and computer security. He earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Berkeley in 2003 and joined ICSI to study network security and measurement. "The entire cryptocurrency and blockchain ecology is rife with frauds, criminalities, and tulip-mania style hype and needs to be properly disposed of into the ashes of history. A “blockchain” is just a horribly inefficient append-only file which costs a literal fortune to secure without actually providing meaningful distributed trust, while cryptocurrencies are provably inferior than actual currencies for legal real world transactions. Beyond the sheer uselessness have emerged a whole host of bad ideas, ranging from the “put a bird^H^H^H^H blockchain on it” hype to unregistered (and mostly fraudulent) securities with “Initial Coin Offerings” to an invitation for massive theft in the form of “smart” contracts."
* [Ross Anderson et al: Bitcoin Redux: crypto crime, and how to tackle it](https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/06/01/bitcoin-redux-crypto-crime-and-how-to-tackle-it/) ([full paper](https://weis2018.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/05/WEIS_2018_paper_38.pdf))- 2018-06-01 - Anderson is a Professor of Security Engineering at the University Cambridge. Bitcoin Redux explains what’s going wrong in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a "balance" and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they’re both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters. We’ve been looking at the details.
  * [Ross Anderson: Why Bitcoin is Not Cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9HH_dFcoLc) - 2018-04-10 - 📺 walks through why bitcoin is not cash and the complex legal questions it would need to deal with if it wanted to be.

* [Simon Wardley: A Spoiler for the Future of Bitcoin](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2013/11/a-spoiler-for-future-bitcoin.html) - 2013-11-27 - "As you can guess, I'm not a fan of bitcoin. If left unchecked then I find it has the potential to undermine the importance of Government which is actually not good for competition and not good for the market. I hope none of the above happens and would rather see bitcoin disappear in a puff of history." (NB: he predicts massive appreciation in bitcoin and is concerned how it can undermine government and tax revenue.)
* Kai Stinchcombe series that discusses whether blockchain can solve various real world use-cases better than traditional technologies
  - [Kai Stinchcombe: Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain](https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100) - 2017-12-23 - "Each purported use case — from payments to legal documents, from escrow to voting systems—amounts to a set of contortions to add a distributed, encrypted, anonymous ledger where none was needed. What if there isn’t actually any use for a distributed ledger at all? What if, ten years after it was invented, the reason nobody has adopted a distributed ledger at scale is because nobody wants it?"
  - [Kai Stinchcombe: Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future](https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec) - 2018-05-04 - "Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future. Its failure to achieve adoption to date is because systems built on trust, norms, and institutions inherently function better than the type of no-need-for-trusted-parties systems blockchain envisions. That’s permanent: no matter how much blockchain improves it is still headed in the wrong direction."
* [Cory Doctorow: When crypto-exchanges go broke, you'll lose it all](https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/03/liquidation-preference/#we-live-in-a-society) - 2022-02-03. Why state backed money is a good thing (a feature not a bug).
  > If you've spent much time around cryptocurrency people, you've probably heard a rant or two about "sound money" and the need to "depoliticize money." This is a foundation of blockchainism: the belief that money is born separate from states, and states invade on the private realm when they "meddle" in the money system.
  >
  > There are at least two serious problems with this ideology. First, it's plain wrong on the historical facts. Money did not emerge from barter systems among people. Money was and is a product of state.
  >
  > But even if you stipulate that money didn't originate among private markets there's another serious historical problem with "sound money." ... It's this: central banks didn't emerge to usurp the private sector's control over money. Central banks were created because without them, finance was subject to wild, terrifying, ruinous boom/bust cycles. What's more, without a central bank, money was subject to naked political meddling, which central banks (sometimes) moderated.

### Ponzi aspect

* [Financial Times: Why bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme](https://web.archive.org/web/20220113183816/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/rm78e3/financial_times_why_bitcoin_is_worse_than_a/) - 2021-12-22. A Ponzi scheme is a zero-sum enterprise. But bitcoin is a negative-sum phenomenon that you can’t even pursue a claim against, argues Robert McCauley.

  > Once upon a time in Albania, a scrappy, alternative finance industry emerged to take on and eventually supplant a sclerotic, technologically-backward banking system. The lessons from its dramatic collapse remain relevant today. 
  >
  > Essentially, what was initially touted as a post-communist entrepreneurial success story proved to be pyramid schemes of breathtaking proportions. Slick marketing and lofty promises turned an informal, decentralised, crime-facilitating ecosystem into a mainstream mania that sucked in multitudes of people, unchecked by feeble and fitful regulatory warnings.

### DAOs

* [Is The DAO going to be DOA?](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@dan/is-the-dao-going-to-be-doa) - 2016-05-16 - by Dan Larimer (founder of BitShares and much else). Larimer sets out most of the basic critiques of DAOs as governance innovation extremely well:
  > Fancy technology can obscure our assessment of what is really going on. The DAO solves a single problem: the corrupt trustee or administrator. It replaces voluntary compliance with a corporation’s charter under threat of lawsuit, with automated compliance with software defined rules. This subtle change may be enough to bypass regulatory hurdles facing traditional trustee’s and administrators, but it doesn’t solve most of the problems the regulations were attempting to address.
  >
  > What The DAO doesn’t solve is all of the other problems inherent with any joint venture. These are people problems, economic problems, and political problems. In some sense, The DAO creates many new problems caused by its ridged rules and expensive machine-enforced process for change.
  >
  > The DAO doesn’t solve the “group trap” where by losers subsidize winners. It disempowers the individual actor and forces him to submit to group decision making. It doesn’t make raising money cheaper for companies, it just adds blockchain-enforced bureaucratic and political processes.

* [Bennett Tomlin: Tether and Bitfinex Introduction](https://bennettftomlin.com/2021/08/08/tether-and-bitfinex-introduction/) - 2021-08-10 - Tether and Bitfinex are two of the most important companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tether is the largest stablecoin, and the primary driver of volume and liquidity. Bitfinex used to be the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and still is a frequently used exchange. Tether and Bitfinex have an incredibly problematic past and are quite possibly the largest corporate fraud in history.

## Iron-manning the pro arguments

Here we collect the best theses for why this is important/interesting/world-changing.

### Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin for the Open-Minded Skeptic](https://www.matthuang.com/bitcoin_for_the_open_minded_skeptic) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]. Note: more an argument for why Bitcoin will "make it" than any argument why that is socially valuable (or not).
* [7 Things To Read About Bitcoin (For Institutional Investors)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/05/7-things-to-read-about-bitcoin-for-institutional-investors/) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]

### Web3

* [Sean Bonner: Why Web3](https://blog.seanbonner.com/2021/10/26/why-web3/) - 2021-10-26 - by Sean Bonner. "Web3 upends the power structures we’ve grown accustomed to and puts artists and creators back into the drivers seat. ,,, Web3 offers a future where people are in charge of their own identities, not beholden to the whims of data hoarding corporations. People control their own accounts, own their own futures. ... So if you are asking “Why Web3?” The answer is simple. Web3 is the future."

### Fat protocols

From https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/

> The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of “thin” protocols and “fat” applications.
>
> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” applications.

* [Fat Protocols](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) - Aug 2016 - Joel Monegro at USV - more about incentivizing adoption

### Fairer governance

Can support more democratic, distributed governance, e.g. cooperatives (somehow). Can save Democracy.

* [If I Only had a Heart: a DisCO Manifesto](https://disco.coop/manifesto/) - Dec 2019 - A joint publication by DisCO.coop, the Transnational Institute and Guerrilla Media Collective. "Value Sovereignty, Care Work, Commons and Distributed Cooperative Organizations. The DisCO Manifesto is a deep dive into the world of Distributed Cooperative Organizations. Over its 80 colorful pages, you will read about how DisCOs are a P2P/Commons, cooperative and Feminist Economic alternative to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The DisCO Manifesto also includes some background on topics like blockchain, AI, the commons, feminism, cooperatives, cyberpunk, and more."
* [Wired: The Father of Web3 Wants You to Trust Less](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/) - 2021-11-29 - Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3 in 2014, believes decentralized technologies are the only hope of preserving liberal democracy.

### Fairer Economy

* [Li Jin on the future of the creator economy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/li-jin-on-the-future-of-the-creator-economy) - Shared ownership and control of online platforms is the way forward (via crypto)
  * Note: we probably all want that wonderful outcome it's just that crypto is neither necessary nor likely to get us there. See https://rufuspollock.com/fixing-facebook/
